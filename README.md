Training data for sentiment analysis. This will be used in conjunction with
the open source sentiment analysis project in order to provide something
with which to train with. It's the transcripts of only around 1500 talks,
but it's quite a lot of text. Definetely not the best corpus out there,
but I believe it will be the only large non-binary sentiment analysis corpus.
